# EWS-Mapping-for-GLOF

## Overview

The **EWS-Mapping-for-GLOF** repository provides tools for simulating and mapping the potential flood paths resulting from Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). GLOFs are catastrophic events that occur when water dams formed by glaciers break, leading to sudden flooding. This project aims to assist in the development of Early Warning Systems (EWS) to predict and mitigate the impacts of GLOFs by analyzing potential flood zones.

The project is designed to help researchers and disaster management teams assess and visualize the areas at risk from GLOFs and plan evacuation strategies accordingly.

## Repository Contents

- **Flood_Path_Simulation.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that simulates flood paths from potential GLOFs using geospatial data. It visualizes the affected regions, helping to predict flood dynamics and assess potential risks.

## Features

- Simulation of flood paths caused by glacial lake outbursts.
- Visualization of flood inundation zones and hazard mapping.
- Use of geospatial libraries like **GeoPandas** and **Rasterio** for accurate spatial data manipulation.
- Aiding in the creation of Early Warning Systems (EWS) for GLOFs.

## Requirements

To run the `Flood_Path_Simulation.ipynb` notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
- `scipy`: For scientific computing and simulations.
- `geopandas`: For geospatial data manipulation.
- `shapely`: For geometric operations.
- `rasterio`: For reading and processing raster data (e.g., elevation maps).

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy geopandas shapely rasterio
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gaurav20112003/EWS-Mapping-for-GLOF.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd EWS-Mapping-for-GLOF
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Flood_Path_Simulation.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the flood path simulations and visualize the results.

## Data

The notebook relies on geospatial data (e.g., Digital Elevation Models) to simulate flood paths. Ensure that you have access to appropriate datasets, or you can use open-source data available online, such as from the USGS or NASA.
